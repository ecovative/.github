**We Grow Better Materials**

Ecovative is pioneering the future of sustainable materials through mycelium technology. We're building the foundation for a new materials economy that transforms biological systems into high-performance, eco-friendly solutions for packaging, food, textiles, construction, and beyond.

## ðŸŒ± About Us

Ecovative harnesses the power of myceliumâ€”the root structure of mushroomsâ€”to create sustainable alternatives to conventional materials. Our team of mycologists, engineers, and innovators is united in the mission to create material abundance through biotechnology while reducing environmental impact.

Our proprietary mycelium technology platform serves as the foundation for multiple product lines and applications. With over 16 years of expertise in mycelium cultivation and materials science, we've developed scalable processes that transform wildtype gourmet mycelium into functional materials.
